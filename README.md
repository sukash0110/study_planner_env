# EduDynamics 1.1.1

EduDynamics is a real-world OpenEnv reinforcement learning environment for student study planning across math, physics, and chemistry under energy, balance, and long-horizon retention constraints.

![EduDynamics logo](ui/assets/edudynamics-logo.svg)

This submission includes:

- a validator-ready OpenEnv environment with `reset()`, `step()`, and `state()`
- three tasks (`easy`, `medium`, `hard`) with deterministic grading in the `0.0` to `1.0` range
- a root `inference.py`, Docker/Hugging Face deployment path, and public demo
- shaped rewards covering performance, subject balance, energy efficiency, spacing, retention, and recovery

- Hugging Face Space: [EduDynamics](https://huggingface.co/spaces/sukash0110/study_planner_env)

Version `1.1.1` improves judge-facing benchmark quality with `AuraUI 1.1.1`, a harder deadline-aware long-horizon task, and a stronger grader that scores deadline readiness alongside reward, mastery, and balance.

## Submission Checklist Alignment

This repo is structured to satisfy the common first-round validator checks:

- FastAPI Space deployment with a `200` response at `/`
- HTTP environment endpoints for `reset`, `step`, and `state`
- root-level `inference.py`
- three tasks and a normalized grader score in the `0.0` to `1.0` range
- Dockerfile build path for automated repo validation
- pre-submission validation script via `python validate_submission.py`
- environment variable placeholders for `API_BASE_URL`, `MODEL_NAME`, and `HF_TOKEN`
- OpenAI baseline support through `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- OpenEnv packaging pieces including `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`, and `server/app.py`

## Project Layout

The repository is organized so the hackathon-required root entry points still exist, while the main implementation lives in named folders:

- `ui/`: Streamlit dashboard implementation
- `runtime/`: inference agents and episode runner
- `evaluation/`: grader logic and scoring
- `tooling/`: local validation utilities
- `study_env/`: OpenEnv environment, typed models, API, and tasks
- `server/`: hybrid Hugging Face deployment entrypoint
- root wrappers: compatibility files for `app.py`, `inference.py`, `grader.py`, and `validate_submission.py`

## Why This Environment Matters

Real students do not just maximize raw study hours. They must:

- allocate time across competing subjects
- manage limited daily energy
- decide when to learn, reinforce, or recover
- avoid over-optimizing one subject while neglecting others

This makes study planning a strong real-world sequential decision problem. Short-term gains can hurt long-term performance if the policy ignores balance or recovery.

What this environment evaluates well:

- long-horizon planning under energy and recovery constraints
- retention-aware scheduling instead of short-term reward chasing
- balancing uneven subject progress against deadline pressure
- deciding when revision is better than more studying

## What The Agent Controls

At every step, the agent chooses one of seven actions:

- `0`: study math
- `1`: study physics
- `2`: study chemistry
- `3`: revise math
- `4`: revise physics
- `5`: revise chemistry
- `6`: rest

Each episode spans multiple days, and each day contains three decision slots.

## Environment Design

The environment implements:

- `reset()`
- `step(action)` returning `(state, reward, done, info)`
- `state()`

Core simulation elements:

- three subjects with independent mastery values
- finite energy budget
- multi-day progression
- separate effects for studying, revising, and resting
- deterministic and stochastic execution modes

## Reward Design

The reward is intentionally multi-objective rather than a simple score delta.

It combines:

- average performance improvement
- balance across subjects
- energy efficiency
- targeted support for the weakest subject
- penalties for subject imbalance
- penalties for poor low-energy decisions
- mild penalties for wasteful rest actions

This encourages policies that make consistent progress without collapsing into one-subject optimization.

## Tasks

- `easy`: 5 days, lower mastery targets
- `medium`: 10 days, moderate planning horizon
- `hard`: 15 days, longer horizon with stronger balance demands, weighted subject priorities, and deadline pressure

## Baseline Agent

The project includes two baseline modes:

- `openai`: uses the official OpenAI Python client and reads `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `heuristic`: deterministic offline fallback for local validation and no-network runs

The deterministic fallback policy adapts to:

- current energy level
- weakest subject
- mastery imbalance

Behavior summary:

- rests when energy is critically low
- revises the weakest subject when imbalance becomes large
- studies the weakest subject when mastery is still behind
- stays reproducible for grading

The OpenAI baseline runs with temperature `0` so the action policy remains reproducible for a fixed model and prompt.

## What's New In 1.1.1

- upgraded the hard task with subject weighting and deadline pressure so greedy studying is less effective
- added deadline readiness as an explicit grader dimension alongside reward, mastery, and balance
- strengthened the README framing around what frontier model abilities this benchmark measures
- bumped the interface layer to `AuraUI 1.1.1`
- kept the organization, hybrid deployment, and real-learning model improvements from `1.1.0`

## Grading Strategy

The grader evaluates the deterministic baseline on all three tasks and reports:

- total reward
- average mastery
- balance gap
- remaining energy
- step count
- pass/fail checks against explicit thresholds

This makes the benchmark easier to interpret in a hackathon review setting.

## Hugging Face Demo

Live Space:

[https://huggingface.co/spaces/sukash0110/study_planner_env](https://huggingface.co/spaces/sukash0110/study_planner_env)

This repo is configured as a Docker-based Hugging Face Space and serves the `1.1.0` hybrid deployment on port `8501`:

- `/` shows a branded landing page with the embedded Streamlit demo
- `/ui` serves the full Streamlit application natively
- `/api/*` serves the OpenEnv-compatible API
- `/health` remains available through the mounted API

For validator-style API checks, the deployment also exposes:

- `GET /api/`
- `GET /api/health`
- `GET /api/tasks`
- `POST /api/reset`
- `POST /api/step`
- `GET /api/state`

## Required Environment Variables

The project includes `.env.example` with the required names:

- `API_BASE_URL`
- `MODEL_NAME`
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `HF_TOKEN`

These are available as environment placeholders in the Docker image and can be overridden in your deployment configuration.

## Environment Notes

- studying gives larger gains but now interacts with spacing, fatigue, and memory durability
- revision improves one subject, reinforces others, and reduces retention risk when timed well
- end-of-day consolidation and forgetting make the learning loop more realistic
- rest restores energy and supports sustainable planning
- deterministic mode is intended for reproducible evaluation
- stochastic and randomize modes are intended for exploratory analysis
